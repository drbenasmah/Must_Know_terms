ALGORITHM

An algorithm is a set of instructions or a procedure to accomplish a specific task or solve a particular problem. It's like a recipe that outlines a series of steps to follow to achieve a desired outcome. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, including natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, and programming languages.

Algorithms are widely used in computer programming, data processing, and other fields that require problem-solving. In computer programming, algorithms are essential to designing efficient and effective software solutions. They are used to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple operations such as sorting and searching to complex tasks like machine learning and artificial intelligence.

An algorithm must meet certain criteria to be considered valid. It must be unambiguous, meaning that each step is well-defined and clear. It must also be deterministic, meaning that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. Additionally, an algorithm must terminate, meaning that it eventually produces a result or an error message after a finite number of steps.
